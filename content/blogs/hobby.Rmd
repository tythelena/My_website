#Ballroom dancing and me

Four years ago, I firstly got to know about ballroom dancing at the welcome party of Tsinghua University and joined the ballroom dancing team. 

After 2 years of learning and training, I become more and more sophisticated in modern dance and chose for further improvement in that field. At the second year I participated in a competition of waltz and surprisingly got the first prize. Though my partner and I are so nervous at that time, it turned out to be a good result. 

At my last year in Tsinghua University, we decided to put forward a solo performance in front of university. We chose the song lovely and designed the performance by ourselves. The music and performance had such an satisfying result that we even received congratulations of professional dancers from Beijing Ballroom dance team. The announcement and photo taken at the performance is below.
