# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Greece") # just choosing Greece, as this is where I come from

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Europe")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
 plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL

 plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "Changes of life expectancy in Greece ",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
   NULL


 plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 ggplot(gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= country, group = country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= continent ))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Type your answer after this blockquote.

Asia and Africa have more developing countries than other continents, therefore, their average life expectances are shorter than others in a long time. However, some countries, such as Japan and China, experienced their revolution and the government started to be open to other civilizations. Also they put more importance and money assistance in developing medical technology. Years later, the life expectance in Asia became longer than Africa. 

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.

Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```
One of the more useful things one can do with any data set is quick counts, namely to see how many observations fall within one category. For instance, if we wanted to count the number of incidents by year, we would either use `group_by()... summarise()` or, simply [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

Let us try to see how many incidents we have by animal group. Again, we can do this either using group_by() and summarise(), or by using count()

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

Do you see anything strange in these tables? 

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

There is two things we will do:

1. Calculate the mean and median `incident_notional_cost` for each `animal_group_parent`
2. Plot a boxplot to get a feel for the distribution of `incident_notional_cost` by `animal_group_parent`.


Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

Now tht incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group. 


```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```



Compare the mean and the median for each animal group. waht do you think this is telling us?
Anything else that stands out? Any outliers?

A:For most animal, mean of incident cost are always larger than median of that, which is mainly because there must be some outlier that need a huge cost in specific situation. Therefore, the mean of data will be lifted up by those outliers. Besides, as the mean is more close to min value than max, it also demonstrate that there are outliers with large incident cost in the database. 

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values? Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

A:The boxplot. Animals above can be divided into several categories: pets, domestic animals and wild ones. For pat, since most dogs and cats are small and have a limited space to live, the average cost of rescuing is less than others. For those benefiting people’s life and comparatively large animals, like horse and cow, it is somehow more expensive to locate and help them. And for those wild animals (snake and squirrel), the frequency of rescuing them are lower and it may be necessary only if the animal are in danger. Therefore, the average cost is also not very high.
