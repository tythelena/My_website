<p>2019 was the year I went to University of British Columbia to have a life of one term as an exchange student. For the first time living abroad for half a year, I was deeply impressed by the school life and also everything experienced there.
I was allocated with a studio in the school, from which window the seashore and sunset can be seen every day.</p>
<p>I also had a good time on Halloween with customs and make up to attend the large party on that night. That was really great and unforgettable experience for an exchange student like me.</p>

<p>After the term in UBC, I spent 3 weeks travelling in Canada with my friends. We have been to Yellowknife to see the aurora. And also we visited Banff and emerged into the splendid snow views there.</p>

<p>Though the experience only took half a year, the memories and lessons I have gained probably will become my treasure for whole life.</p>
