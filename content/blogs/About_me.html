<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi! This is Yiting Tang, a Chinese girl who used to major in economics and finance and minor in computer science. Itâ€™s really a fortune to meet you guys in LBS and improve together. Here are some details to help you know me better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Background:</li>
</ul>
<p>Born at a coastal city of China, Shenzhen, which is close to Hongkong, I grew up with international view and was familiar with the busy life in modern city. In the early 20 years in my life, my family and I paid much importance on comprehensive development, which led me to Tsinghua University, the top 2 in China, and cultivated various hobbies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personality</li>
</ul>
<p>What I believe most important in my study life is the quality of <strong>quick learning</strong>, which has helped me through lots of difficulties and new knowledge. Not only in my study life, but also the whole career, whatever job I contribute in, it will also be a necessary. Besides, I benefit from the skill of <strong>well communication</strong> in study and life. Making friends and talking to others are not a tough task for me and what I enjoy most is learning from others through communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobbies</li>
</ul>
<p>As for spare time, I hang out with friends and enjoy various hobbies. I spent three years in university continually learning and practicing <strong>ballroom dancing</strong> so that I gained the opportunity to many competitions and performance. Last year I also presented a show dance with my partner in front of hundreds of audiences. Here is a picture of my show.</p>
<p>Hope those above let you know who I am and hope you meet you one day.</p>
