2019 was the year I went to University of British Columbia to have a life of one term as an exchange student. For the first time living abroad for half a year, I was deeply impressed by the school life and also everything experienced there. 
I was allocated with a studio in the school, from which window the seashore and sunset can be seen every day. 

I also had a good time on Halloween with customs and make up to attend the large party on that night. That was really great and unforgettable experience for an exchange student like me.

After the term in UBC, I spent 3 weeks travelling in Canada with my friends. We have been to Yellowknife to see the aurora. And also we visited Banff and emerged into the splendid snow views there.

Though the experience only took half a year, the memories and lessons I have gained probably will become my treasure for whole life.
